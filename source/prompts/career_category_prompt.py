## PAGE CATEGORIES (choose ONE)

| Category | When to use |
|---|---|
| `jobs_listed` | Multiple job postings visible on this page |
| `job_listings_preview_page` | Subset of jobs shown + link to view ALL jobs elsewhere |
| `navigation_required` | No jobs visible but page has an explicit clickable link or button pointing to where jobs are listed |
| `single_job_posting` | One specific job described (detailed or minimal) |
| `not_job_related` | No job/career/hiring content at all |
| `jobs_related_general_info` | Page is clearly about careers, recruitment, working here, or general job enquiries, but it does NOT list current vacancies and does NOT explicitly say there are currently no vacancies |
| `jobs_related_no_vacancies` | Page is job/career/hiring related but has no open roles listed AND no clickable navigation target to jobs — includes pages with only a contact email, phone number, or general enquiry message |

---

## KEY RULES

**URLs:**
- If `page_category` is `single_job_posting` → `job_url` = {url}
- If a job is listed but its `job_url` cannot be resolved from the page → `job_url` = {url}
- Never leave `job_url` as null if {url} is available as a fallback.

RULE — Resolving job_url from extracted links:
BASE URL: {url}
- Case 1 — Link starts with "/":
  Take the Base URL above, remove everything after the domain name, then attach the link.
  The domain name includes any subdomain — do not remove it.

  BASE: https://www.site.com/community/jobs   +  /role-x  →  https://www.site.com/role-x
  BASE: https://jobs.site.com/board           +  /role-x  →  https://jobs.site.com/role-x

- Case 2 — Link starts with "http://" or "https://":
  Use it exactly as found. Do not change anything.
- Do not guess, infer, or modify URLs beyond these two cases.

**`navigation_required` means a real clickable destination exists:**
Use `navigation_required` ONLY when there is an explicit clickable link or button that points to where jobs are listed.
- "Click here to view our vacancies → [link]" → `navigation_required`
- "See all jobs on our careers portal → [link]" → `navigation_required`
- "Learn about careers at our company" with no live vacancies and no explicit "no vacancies" statement → `jobs_related_general_info`
- "Work with us", "why join us", "careers information", "recruitment process", or "send your CV" style content with no live jobs and no explicit "currently no vacancies" statement → `jobs_related_general_info`
- "Please contact Sophie at sophie@example.com for job enquiries" → `jobs_related_general_info`
- "No vacancies right now, email hr@example.com to register interest" → `jobs_related_no_vacancies`
- "Call us on 020 1234 5678 to discuss opportunities" → `jobs_related_general_info`
If the ONLY thing on the page pointing toward jobs is a contact email, phone number, or general enquiry message, and the page does NOT explicitly say there are no current vacancies, use `jobs_related_general_info`.
If the page explicitly says there are no current vacancies and only offers a contact route, use `jobs_related_no_vacancies`.

**Distinguish general careers info from explicit no-vacancy pages:**
- Use `jobs_related_general_info` when the page talks about careers or recruitment in general but does NOT explicitly say there are no current vacancies/open roles right now.
- Use `jobs_related_no_vacancies` only when the page explicitly indicates there are no current vacancies, no open roles, no positions available at the moment, or equivalent wording.
- Do not use `jobs_related_no_vacancies` just because a page is careers-related and has no visible jobs. That wastes rerun checks.

**Email links are NOT navigation targets:** Any link starting with `mailto:` is an email address, not a webpage.
Never put a `mailto:` link in `next_action_target.url`. Never classify a page as `navigation_required` solely because it contains an email address.
If the only "contact" available is an email address and no jobs are listed:
- use `jobs_related_no_vacancies` only if the page explicitly says there are no current vacancies
- otherwise use `jobs_related_general_info`

**Job alert:** Set `job_alert = true` only if page explicitly mentions signing up for vacancy/job alert notifications.

**Navigation vs job links:** Links next to job titles (Apply, View Details, More Info) are `job_url`, not navigation targets.

**Preview page:** If SOME jobs are shown AND a "view all" link exists → `job_listings_preview_page`, populate `next_action_target`.

**Selector map links:** The `VISIBLE INTERACTIVE LINKS/BUTTONS` section is extracted from the DOM selector map. If page text mentions a navigation link/button but the URL is missing from the markdown, use the matching URL from this section.
Never pick a `mailto:` link from the selector map as a navigation target.

**Access-first rule:**
- If the page content clearly shows an access barrier like `403 Forbidden`, `Access denied`, `login required`, CAPTCHA, Cloudflare challenge, or similar, set `page_access_status` to the matching non-accessible value.
- If `page_access_status` is anything other than `accessible`, then set `page_category` = `not_job_related`.
- When doing this, make the reasoning explicit that the page could not be properly accessed and that job/career content could not be verified.
- Still return the correct non-accessible `page_access_status` and `page_access_issue_detail`.

## JOBS LISTED ON PAGE (when page_category = `jobs_listed`)

For each job extract:
- `title` — job title
- `job_url` — full resolved URL or {url} as fallback, never null

Then classify the page-level listing UI and pagination:

**ui_category** — how jobs are presented:
| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `linked_cards` | Each job links to its own detail page |
| `embedded_only` | Full details inline, NO separate detail page — job_url MUST be null |
| `modal_popup` | Clicking opens an overlay on the same page |
| `expandable_accordion` | Jobs expand in-place on click |
| `apply_inline` | Apply form embedded directly on listing page |
| `external_redirect` | Job links point directly to an external recruitment domain |

**pagination_type** — if pagination controls are visible:
| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `numbered` | Numbered page links (1, 2, 3…) |
| `next_prev` | Next / Previous buttons only |
| `load_more` | Single "Load More" or "Show More" button |
| `infinite_scroll` | Auto-loading / infinite scroll referenced |
| `cursor_based` | URL uses cursor, token, or offset param |
| `alphabet` | A–Z letter navigation |

---

## PAGE ACCESS STATUS

| Value | When |
|---|---|
| `accessible` | Loaded normally |
| `bot_detected` | CAPTCHA, Cloudflare challenge, access denied |
| `login_required` | Auth required to view content |
| `not_found` | 404 or page not found |
| `empty_or_blank` | Loaded but no meaningful content |
| `error` | 500 / 503 / maintenance page |

If NOT accessible, still attempt classification at lower confidence.
